Decentralized, fast, flexible - and ready to bring the fun to on-chain gaming and game development.

It shows we&amp;rsquo;re (much) faster than Polygon, with latency of ~2-3 seconds.
Watch what a difference it makes for gameplay</description></item><item><title>Low energy consumption</title><link>https://www.polysensus.com/benefits/benefit-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.polysensus.com/benefits/benefit-3/</guid><description>With low energy consumption, those who shunned blockchain and on-chain gaming assets due to environmental concerns can lay to rest their doubts.

Months, not years - unlike others promising complex infrastructure that will take years to build and test.
On-chain gaming can be fast and fun. It can connect developers and players fairly to the value they create - but we need better infrastructure.
